## Class Introductions  

While this assignment is not required, you are strongly encouraged to post your introduction and respond to a few introductions to meet your classmates this week. People are inherently social, and forming a learning community is an important way to connect â€” both to your class and to what you're learning. You will find a discussion forum located on the main course page in the **General Information and Forums** section called **Class Introductions**.  

### What to Include  
Please share a few things about yourself with the rest of our class, such as:  
- Your name  
- Where you are from  
- Community activities  
- Your career progression so far  
- Your career aspirations  
- And any other information you're comfortable sharing  

At the very least, please take a moment to say hello to the group!  

### Guidelines for a "Good" Introduction  
There are no strict rules for what makes a "good" introduction. Your goal is to start class with a smile and find ways to connect with your classmates.  
- Perhaps someone is from the same area as you.  
- You might share a common hobby or have the same type of pet.  

### Engage with Your Classmates  
- Respond to a few of your peers' posts and share things you may have in common.  
- Visit the **Course Forum** and **Class Introductions** throughout the first week to:  
  - Respond to posts from your fellow classmates.  
  - Reply to anyone who responds to your introduction.  

> Starting the class with these connections can enrich your learning experience and create a supportive learning community!
