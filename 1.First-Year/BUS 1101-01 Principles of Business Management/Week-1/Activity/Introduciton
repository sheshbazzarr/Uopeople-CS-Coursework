# Introduction  

Welcome to Unit 1!  

Unit 1 provides an overview of the managerâ€™s role in the business environment. You will learn the basic managerial concepts of **planning, organizing, leading, and controlling (P-O-L-C)**. The unit focuses on the importance of performance as an outcome of business activity. These concepts will be explored on both an individual and organizational level. You will also consider how your own management or workplace experience relates to the theories presented in this unit and their application in the workplace.  

### The Role of Managers  
- **Public Companies**: Owned by shareholders and rely on managers to coordinate employee activities and achieve organizational goals.  
- **Privately Owned Businesses and Non-Profit Organizations**: Require managers to ensure smooth operations and fulfillment of objectives.  
- **Entrepreneurial Ventures**: Depend on managers to drive innovation and success.  

Managers are entrusted with the responsibility of running the business on behalf of its owners. The overview you receive this week establishes the foundation for learning managerial skills in the weeks to come. Look for opportunities to apply your learning in your personal and professional life.  

### Reading Focus for Unit 1  
The Unit 1 reading introduces basic concepts of management:  
- **Large and Small Businesses**: Both require competent managers and effective management practices.  
- **Historical Perspective**: Commerce historically relied on family businesses. As businesses expand, the need for managers to coordinate resources and meet objectives grows.  
- **S-M-A-R-T Goal Setting**: As you read Chapter 1 in the *Management Principles* text, focus on the **S-M-A-R-T goal-setting process**:  
  - Specific  
  - Measurable  
  - Aggressive  
  - Realistic  
  - Time-bound  

Consider how you might apply **S-M-A-R-T goal setting** in your personal or professional life. This concept will be further examined in future units.
