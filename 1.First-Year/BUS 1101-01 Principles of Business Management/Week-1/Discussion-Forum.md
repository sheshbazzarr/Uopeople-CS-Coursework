Hi Dear Respected Classmates,

Management is “The art of getting things done through the efforts of other people” (Carpenter et al., 2010, para 3). This definition is not merely about management being the act of telling others what to do. Instead, it emphasizes the underlying framework of **Planning → Organizing → Leading → Controlling (P-O-L-C)**, which forms the foundation of management. It is an art, not a dogma, of how things are done. People often misconceive management as a purely social science, assuming it is only about interacting with people. However, this is not the case. Management often involves much more than that.

For example, in tech companies, whether start-ups or small service providers, there is often a management team, known as **product managers**. These individuals are frequently engineers who possess both technical knowledge and a clear understanding of business requirements. They are responsible for planning, organizing, and leading the development of products.

The preconceived notion of management for most people is a traditional one. However, times have changed. In the contemporary world, management is an umbrella term that encompasses various roles and functions. Many companies have multiple sub-management teams. For instance, in the field of software engineering, **agile** and **scrum** methodologies have introduced new approaches to project management. Teams are often divided by skill levels, and senior developers may take on managerial roles, overseeing components of a project and tracking its progress.

Thus, management is not solely about managing people but also about overseeing and coordinating the work itself. In my view, management resembles the role of a **pilot** navigating a ship. It requires an understanding of various dynamics, including internal team emotions, market conditions, and technical requirements specific to the industry.
