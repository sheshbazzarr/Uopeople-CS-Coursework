Discussion Forum for Week 1

Discussion Forum
In this assignment, we delve into the fascinating world of logic gates and their role in a basic arithmetic circuit designed for binary addition. We will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the circuit's behavior with varying inputs, categorizing the possible outcomes based on the rules of binary arithmetic. Let's embark on this logical exploration to unravel the intricacies of binary addition.

Explore the logic gates used in a basic arithmetic circuit for binary addition. You are given two 2-bit binary inputs, A and B, and your task is to design a combinational logic circuit that performs the addition operation (A + B) and produces the 2-bit result C.

1. Utilize logic gates such as AND, OR, and XOR gates in your design.

2. Present the truth table and circuit diagram for this arithmetic circuit to illustrate its functioning.

3. Provide a step-by-step explanation of how the inputs are processed through the gates to obtain the final output.

4. Furthermore, conduct an analysis of the circuit's behavior when different inputs are applied, and categorize the possible outcomes based on the rules of binary arithmetic.
